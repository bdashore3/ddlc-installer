# ddlc-installer
(c) kingbri 

This is the universal installer for DDLC mods

What does this include?
- A python script to package into your mod zip 
- If your mod has just a game folder, this script can easily be used
- Otherwise, you have to edit a few things

IP violations? Not at all with Zudo's DDLC download python script

This also includes my method of making DDLC standalone and cross-platform between all
PCs/Macs

Hope you enjoy!

Depends on: Python 3 and the requests module
- Get python 3 here: https://python.org or through your package manager (brew install python3)
- Install the requests module by typing "pip install requests" in your command prompt/terminal
